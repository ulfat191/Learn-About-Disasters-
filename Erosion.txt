River Soil Erosion:
Before:
Vegetation: The simplest and most natural way to prevent erosion is through planting vegetation. Plants establish root systems, which stabilizes soil and prevents soil erosion. Erosion and channel-shifting during the monsoon—more specifically, during the rising and recession stage—results in serious damage to livelihoods in Bangladesh. However, the problems can be reduced by constructing low-cost bamboo structures
After: 
Careful tilling: Because tilling activity breaks up the structure of soil, doing less tilling with fewer passes will preserve more of the crucial topsoil. Crop rotation: Plenty of crop rotation is crucial for keeping land happy and healthy. This allows organic matter to build up, making future plantings more fertile. Increased structure for plants: Introducing terraces or other means of stabilizing plant life or even the soil around them can help reduce the chance that the soil loosens and erodes. Boosting areas that are prone to erosion with sturdy plant life can be a great way to stave off future effects. Water control: For those areas where soil erosion is predominantly caused by water – whether natural or man-made – specialized chutes and runoff pipes can help to direct these water sources away from the susceptible areas, helping stave off excess erosion. Having these filters in particular areas rather than leading to natural bodies of water is a focus to reduce pollution. Increased knowledge: A major factor for preventing soil erosion is educating more and more people who work with the land on why it is a concern, and what they can do to help reduce it. This means outreach to farmers in susceptible areas for ways that they can help protect crops from inclement weather, or ways that they can help make sure their soil remains compact without restricting their plant growing activities.
